# **About Me**

Hi! I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I am so happy you are here and excited to briefly describe to you my story with data.

The first time I heard about data was in 2022 and since then I have been fascinated about the data analytics world. I have met great and humble people in the data community who generously guided me through the right path to pursue my dream. Along this journey I have been able to dive deep into programming languages - which I also created a huge passion, data visualization tools and being able to work on projects. 

“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.” - Sherlock Holmes. 
This pearl of wisdom comes from one of the most famous fictional detectives in history, and emphasizes the importance of using data to drive smart decisions. Data analysts are like detectives, trying to solve a case by analyzing, investigating, inquiring and querying, to arrive at an accurate result through data-driven decision-making.

With a curious mind, a keen eye for detail and a passion for solving problems to bring meaningful insights, I am excited to become a data analyst and stay updated with the new tools and techniques which are emeging regularly.

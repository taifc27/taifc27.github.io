# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I am so happy you are here and appreciate your time for taking a look on my portfolio.

The first time I heard about data was in 2022 and since then I have been growing this fascination about the data analytics world. I have met great and humble people in the data community who generously guided me through the right path to pursue my dream. Along this journey I have been able to dive deep into programming languages, data visualization tools and being able to work on projects. 

“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.” - Sherlock Holmes. This pearl of wisdom comes from one of the most famous fictional detectives in history, and emphasizes the importance of using data to drive smart decisions. 
Data Analysts are like detectives, trying solve a case by analyzing, investigating, inquiring and querying. With a curious mind, a keen eye for detail and a passion for solving problems to bring meaningful insights, I am excited to become a data analyst and since this is a ever evolving field I am committed to further my studies, always improving my abilities and technical skills.

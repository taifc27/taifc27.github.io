# Unleashing Flavorful Insights: Excel-ed Delivery!

There is afunny story behind this project and When I told this to my friend that I am doing this aproject, he said "The things that you do for food! Why can't you drop-by at restaurant?". I said, "Let's look at the data." 

## Introduction

DoorDash is an American food delivery service that connects customers with local restaurants. DoorDash operates as an on-demand logistics platform, allowing users to order food from nearby restaurants through its website or mobile app. Evident to say that with their convenient platform for users to order food online and have it delivered to their doorstep with help from 'Dashers' who use their own vehicles, deals and offers of subscription services such as DashPass provifing users with benefits like free delivery on eligible orders for a monthly fee, and partnerships with some grocery stores and convenience stores to provide users with more options. Those are some of the features of Doordash.
Here I am, an unknown food enthusiast with some data skills wanted to see how and why many people are involved with Doordash, and on what food types people are investing their money?
This project will help me improve my skills in data analysis. I wanted to build a dashboard entirely in excel.

I in-fact did an amazing job!
